# HoneyPot
Attempt at making a container-like honeypot (running in kubernetes)

## Introduction
### Background
Honeypots are are a type of technology that can be used for detecting and analyzing attacks (both on systems and networks).  
A honeypot is designed to simulate a system or network resource which has been misconfigured/left due to either negligence or ignorance.  

### Note
A honeypot **does not improve security** of the **actual** system or network.  
It is merely used to gain insight into the types of attacks that are being attempted in or on the system/network.
